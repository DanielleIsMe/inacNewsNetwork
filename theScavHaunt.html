                <h3>Corpo Rat taken out of the game! Scav haunt cleared by up and coming mercs! Mystery email and an assasination attempt?!</h3>
                <h4><u>This is a transcript of a previous broadcast</u></h4>
                <p>"Gooood evening Night City! My name is Signal, and welcome to INAC; a pirate broadcast containing all the coverage you need on everything anti corp, rising stars of the afterlife, and frontline POVS of ops carried out by yours truly!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tonight's main event: an unknown suit, the victim of an attempted assassination undoubtedly at the hands of a corp, hired a fixer to take care of the scavs who roughed them up.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The fixer assembled a crew of Mercs to handle the job. A Rockerchick, Netrunner, Medtech and yours truly formed an unlikely alliance to storm a scav haunt and clear out the gonks for good, and recover some preem Kiroshis ripped out of the suit's head.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Op went smooth as butter, with our rocker and med taking point. The scavs were no match for the psychotic mania of the rockerchick and the medtechs brute force supported by our netrunner, and dropped like flies. We recovered the Kiroshi implants, and along the way found a curious email in the scav's terminal reading “You fucked up. We'll be in touch.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Looks like the scavs were operating on behalf of someone. Was it an internal takedown within the suits own corp? Or was it an attempt at an inter corp assassination? One thing is certain: They were sloppy and hired scavs for what should have been a clean hit. Someone else always has to dirty their hands for these “sparkling pillars of society.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>That's all we have for tonight my dear listeners! You can catch the vid of our Op on the INAC site, it should be uploaded right now!</p>
                <br>
                <p>As always, This is Signal on the pulse of Night City, signing off. See you next time!"</p>
