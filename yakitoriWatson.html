                <p>"Gooood evening Night City! My name is Signal, and welcome to INAC; a pirate broadcast containing all the coverage you need on everything anti corp, rising stars of the afterlife, and showcases of the best eats in Watson!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tonight we have a short one, an expose on one of the best foodstalls in Kabuki: Alec's Yakitori!</p>
                <br>
                <p>After a long day hunting down a scoop, I chanced on a delicious smell that overpowered the usual scent of urine and smoke us Watson folks are so used to. Sitting down at the source, I found myself at a foodstall talking to the owner, Alec.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Alec served me some yakitori, and let me tell you, this was YAKITORI. I don't know how he did it, but this scop tasted just like real chicken! I had three servings before I knew it!</p>
                <br>
                <p>After I finished stuffing my face, I asked Alec what he did to make it taste so good. He told me that he has a secret recipe. I don't know how he does it, but I do know that this is the best yakitori in Kabuki!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've been too many times to count since then, and I'll definitely be going back again!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anyway, that's all I have for you tonight, dear listeners. As always, This is Signal on the pulse of Night City, signing off. See you next time!"</p>
