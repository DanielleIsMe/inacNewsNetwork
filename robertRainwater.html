                <h3>Ever heard of a ripperdoc who's anti-cybernetics? Read below for an exclusive interview!</h3>
                <h4><u>This is a transcript of a previous broadcast</u></h4>
                <p>"Gooood evening Night City! My name is Signal, and welcome to INAC; a pirate broadcast containing all the coverage you need on everything anti corp, rising stars of the afterlife, and exclusive interviews with the most interesting people in Watson!
                <br><br>
                Tonight we have a special guest: Robert Rainwater, a man who has made a name for himself as an anti-cybernetics Ripperdoc. Thanks for coming on my show tonight Mr. Rainwater!"
                <br><br>
                <span class="interviewee">"Thanks for having me, Signal. Good to be here."</span>
                <br><br><br>
                "So, Mr. Rainwater, most rippers in Night City advocate for the use of implants and often chip-in themselves, but you seem to be rather outspoken about your distaste for cybernetics. Why is that?"
                <br><br>
                <span class="interviewee">"Most people don't realise Signal, that the brain functions better when it's attached to real, not-synthetic musculature.</span>
                <br><br><br>
                <span class="interviewee">Replace even a single hand and you'll notice a dip in concentration and overall well-being. Cyberware's more harm than help."</span>
                <br><br><br>
                "Interesting. So, you believe that the brain and body are meant to work together in a natural way? I can see that you take good care of your body Mr. Rainwater, is this to compensate for the fact that you don't want to use cyberware?"
                <br><br>
                <span class="interviewee">"Yep. I work out every day to keep my body in good shape. Don't need to rely on cyberware to keep myself healthy and do my job."</span>
                <br><br><br>
                "That's a very interesting perspective. I know that many people in Night City, me included, use and rely on cyberware to do our jobs. do you think that this is a bad thing?"
                <br><br>
                <span class="interviewee">"Sure is. Unless you can afford supplements or therapy to manage the side effects of your chrome, your brain won't be able to keep a healthy connection with the implants in your body. Over time it's gonna deterioate and you'll lose more than just your concentration."</span>
                <br><br><br><br><br>
                "You have a very unique stance, being a Ripperdoc yourself. Do you feel that your views on cyberware have affected your business?"
                <br><br>
                <span class="interviewee">"Nope, Don't slow biz at all. I get chromers coming in that don't care for the dangers and get all kinds of implants fitted. Long as implants are available, gonks like that will always pay."</span>
                <br><br><br><br>
                "That's good to hear. Well, I think that's all the time we have for today. Thank you for coming on the show Mr. Rainwater!
                <br><br>
                Certainly a unique perspective on cyberware and the human body, huh, dear listeners? I know that I personally rely on my optics to do my job, and I don't think I'd be able to do it without them. But hey, that's just me!"
                <br><br>
                Thanks for tuning in to INAC! As always, This is Signal on the pulse of Night City, signing off. See you next time!"
